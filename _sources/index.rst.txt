Welcome to Porcupine's plugin API documentation!
================================================

This documentation is all about writing your own Porcupine plugins in Python
to make Porcupine do something fun that it doesn't do by default.


The Tutorial
------------

Start by reading this if you're new here. Among other things, it contains a
hello world example with detailed instructions for installing the plugin, but
it also contains a list of things that you need to be careful with or watch
out for.
