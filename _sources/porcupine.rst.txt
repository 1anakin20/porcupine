:mod:`porcupine` --- The top level Porcupine package
====================================================

.. module:: porcupine

Porcupine's ``__init__.py`` doesn't contain much code, but it defines
these things:

.. data:: __version__

    The Porcupine version as a human-readable string.

.. data:: version_info

    A ``(major, minor, patch)`` tuple of integers. Use this if you want
    to check Porcupine's version.
