# My editor

This is a simple and easy-to-use editor for writing Python. You need
Python 3.3 or newer with Tkinter to run this.

This editor supports basic features like syntax highlighting, line
numbers, automatic indenting and stripping trailing whitespace. It does
not support running files directly from the editor, so you need to run
your programs on a command prompt or a terminal.

## How do I run this thing?

Download the editor, `cd` to where you downloaded it and run it like this:

    python3 -m akulis_editor

If you are on Windows, do this instead:

    py -m akulis_editor

Note that you should *not* `cd` to `akulis_editor`.
