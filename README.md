# My editor

This is a simple and easy-to-use editor for writing Python. You need 
Python 3.3 or newer with Tkinter to run this.

This editor supports features like syntax highlighting, line numbers and 
automatic indenting, but you cannot run files directly from this editor. 
This is meant to be an editor that does one thing and does it well.

## How do I run this thing?

Download the editor, `cd` to where you downloaded it and run it like this:

    python3 -m akulis_editor

If you are on Windows, do this instead:

    py -m akulis_editor

Note that you should *not* `cd` to `akulis_editor`.
