# Porcupine

This is a simple and easy-to-use editor for writing Python. You need
Python 3.3 or newer with Tkinter to run this.

This editor supports basic features like syntax highlighting, line
numbers, automatic indenting and stripping trailing whitespace. It does
not support running files directly from the editor, so you need to run
your programs on a command prompt or a terminal.
