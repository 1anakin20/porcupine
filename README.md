# My editor

This is an easy-to-use editor written in Python using Tkinter. You need 
Python 3.2 or newer to run this.

## Well, how do I run it?

Download the editor, `cd` to where you downloaded it and run it like this:

    $ python3 -m akulis_editor

If you are on Windows, do this instead:

    > py -m akulis_editor

Note that you should *not* `cd` to `akulis_editor`.
