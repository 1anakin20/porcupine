# E402 is "module level import not at top of file", flake8 doesn't allow
# metadata like __author__ before the imports in __init__.py
#
# E265 is "block comment should start with '# '", this is disabled to
# allow commenting out lines with no space after #
#
# E226 is "missing whitespace around arithmetic operator", i think
# "a + b*c" is much more readable than "a + b * c" while "a + (b * c)"
# is a bit too verbose
