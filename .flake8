[flake8]
# E402 is "module level import not at top of file", flake8 doesn't allow
# metadata like __author__ before the imports in __init__.py
#
# E265 is "block comment should start with '# '", this is disabled to
# allow commenting out lines with no space after #
#
# E226 is "missing whitespace around arithmetic operator", i think
# "a + b*c" is much more readable than "a + b * c" while "a + (b * c)"
# is a bit too verbose
#
# E501 is the controversial "line too long" warning. I want my code to be
# readable, and a fixed limit is not good for deciding when a line looks
# unreadably long.
#
# W503,W504 are line break before and after binary operator
# pep8 allows both, although it has recommendations for when to use which
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#should-a-line-break-before-or-after-a-binary-operator
