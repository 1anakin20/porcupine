# More plugins!

Porcupine is by default a minimal editor that gets the job done, but
it's by no means *limited* to being a minimal editor. If you want to
play tetris in Porcupine you're in the right place!

Installing these plugins is easy:

1. Figure out where to put the plugins by running this on a terminal or
   command prompt:

        porcupine --print-plugindir

2. Copy/paste a plugin file to your plugin directory.
3. Restart Porcupine.
4. Customize the plugin if you don't like it.
